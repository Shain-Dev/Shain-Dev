- 👋 Hi, I’m @Shain-Dev or you can just call me Shain!
- 👀 I really like to develop things, coding, solving problems (or using google to beg stack overflow to give me a solution) and 
     really love reading about nutrition and fitness in general, it makes me happy :D
- 🌱 I’m currently learning "the odin project", doing their javascript section! Pretty neat i would say.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects or anything which solves a real world problem.
- 📫 How to reach me? Discord:- Poopy#3000
